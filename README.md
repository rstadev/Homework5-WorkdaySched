# Homework5 Workday Scheduler

This was a project issued by the Ga Tech Coding Cootcamp. The aim of this project was to create a daily schedular that would enable a user to log events happening in each hour of the workday and refer to this log as needed. These logs would be saveable to browser, so that if needed, a user can close out of this page and refer back to it when needed. It also displays the current time and date at the top of the page, and color codes each time block to easily identify what event is coming up in a day.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Bootstrap.
